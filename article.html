      <h1>Dancing plague of 1518</h1>
      <h4>
        The dancing plague of 1518, or dance epidemic of 1518, was a case of
        dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (modern-day France),
        in the Holy Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Somewhere
        between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for days.

      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p>
        The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman began to dance fervently in
        a street in Strasbourg.[1] By early September, the outbreak began to
        subside.[2]

        Historical documents, including "physician notes, cathedral sermons,
        local and regional chronicles, and even notes issued by the Strasbourg
        city council" are clear that the victims danced;[1] it is not known why.
        Historical sources agree that there was an outbreak of dancing after a
        single woman started dancing,[3] a group of mostly young women joined
        in, and the dancing did not seem to die down. It lasted for such a long
        time that it attracted the attention of the Strasbourg magistrate and
        bishop, and some number of doctors ultimately intervened, putting the
        afflicted in a hospital.[citation needed]

        Events similar to this are said to have occurred throughout the medieval
        age including 11th century in KÃ¶lbigk Saxony, where it was believed to
        be the cause of demonic possession or divine judgment.[4] In 15th
        century Apulia Italy,[5] a woman was bitten by a tarantula, the venom
        making her dance convulsively. The only way to cure the bite was to
        "shimmy" and to have the right sort of music available, which was an
        accepted remedy by scholars like Athanasius Kircher.[6]
